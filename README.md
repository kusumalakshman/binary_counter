# Binary-Counter-Simulation-using-OpenGL
The binary counter simulation employs computer graphics OpenGL tools to visually display binary digits for 
numbers 0 to 15. Users can initiate the counting process by pressing 's', reset the counter with 'z', 
and reverse the binary digits using 'r'. Through this simulation, users gain hands-on experience with 
binary counting and its practical implementation.
